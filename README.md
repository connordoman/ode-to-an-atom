## Ode to An Atom  

### _By Pablo Neruda_

Infinitesimal *(1)*  
star,  
you seemed  
forever  
buried *(5)*  
in metal, hidden,  
your diabolic  
fire.  
One day  
someone knocked *(10)*  
at your tiny  
door:  
it was man.  
With one  
explosion *(15)*  
he unchained you,  
you saw the world,  
you came out  
into the daylight,  
you traveled through *(20)*  
cities,  
your great brilliance  
illuminated lives,  
you were a  
terrible fruit *(25)*  
of electric beauty,  
you came to  
hasten the flames  
of summer,  
and then *(30)*  
wearing  
a predator's eyglasses,  
armor,  
and a checked shirt,  
sporting sulfuric mustaches *(35)*  
and a prehensile tail,  
came  
the warrior  
and seduced you:  
sleep, *(40)*  
he told you,  
curl up,  
atom, you resemble  
a Greek god,  
a Parisian modiste *(45)*  
in springtime,  
lie down here  
on my fingernail,  
climb into this little box,  
and then *(50)*  
the warrior  
put you in his jacket  
as if you were nothing but  
a North American  
pill, *(55)*  
and he traveled through the world  
and dropped you  
on Hiroshima.  

We awakened.  

The dawn *(60)*  
had been consumed.  
All the birds  
burned to ashes.  
An odor  
of coffins, *(65)*  
gas from tombs, thundered through space.  
The shape of punishment arose,  
hideous,  
superhuman,  
bloody mushroom, dome, *(70)*  
cloud of smoke,  
sword  
of hell.  
Burning air arose,  
spreading death *(75)*  
on parallel waves,  
reaching  
the mother sleeping  
with her child,  
the river fisherman *(80)*  
and the fish,  
the bakery  
and the bread,  
the engineer  
and his buildings; *(85)*  
everything  
was acid  
dust,  
assassin  
air. *(90)*  

The city  
crumbled its last honeycombs  
and fell, fell suddenly,  
demolished,  
rotten; *(95)*  
men  
were instant lepers,  
they took  
their children's hand  
and the little hand *(100)*  
fell off in theirs.  
So, from your refuge  
in the secret  
mantle of stone  
in which fire slept *(105)*  
they took you,  
blinding spark,  
raging light,  
to destroy lives,  
to threaten distant existences, *(110)*  
beneath the sea,  
in the air,  
on the sands,  
in every twist and turn  
of the ports, *(115)*  
to destroy  
seeds,  
to kill cells,  
to stunt the corolla,  
they destined you, atom, *(120)*  
to level  
nations,  
to turn love into a black pustule,  
to burn heaped-up hearts  
and annihilate blood. *(125)*  

Mad spark,  
go back  
to your shroud,  
bury yourself  
in your mineral mantle, *(130)*  
be blind stone once again,  
ignore the outlaws,  
and collaborate  
with life, with growing things,  
replace motors, *(135)*  
elevate energy,  
fertilize planets.  
You have no secret  
now,  
walk *(140)*  
among men  
without your terrible  
mask,  
pick up your pace  
and pace *(145)*  
the picking of the fruit,  
parting  
mountains,  
straightening rivers,  
making fertile, *(150)*  
arom,  
overflowing  
cosmic  
cup,  
return *(155)*  
to the peace of the vine,  
to the velocty of joy,  
return to the province  
of nature,  
place yourself at our service, *(160)*  
and instead of the fatal  
ashes  
of your mask,  
instead of the unleashed infernos  
of your wrath, *(165)*  
instead of the menace  
of your terrible light, deliver to us  
your amazing  
rebelliousness  
for your grain, *(170)*  
your unchained magnetism  
to found peace among men,  
and then your dazzling light  
will be happiness,  
not hell, *(175)*  
hope of morning,  
gift to earth.
